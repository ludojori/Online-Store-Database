Thank you for your interest in the presented group project. This project and its contents are
part of the Database course university assignment. The project is an implemented example of a
database for online tech stores. 

To create the database, execute the following queries in the specified order:

1. Create_Database.sql
2. Insert_ALL_Tables.sql
3. Triggers.sql and Views.sql
4. All other queries

The .doc document and .ppt presentation files are both converted into .pdf format as
Database_Project_2020.pdf and Tech_Store_Presentation.pdf.

Primary use of the Tech_Store_Presentation.pdf is to introduce the user to the project.
Primary use of the Database_Project_2020.pdf is to provide more detailed information on the project,
such as the relations, triggers or queries used, as well as the E/R Diagram.

NOTE:
Create_Database.sql, Triggers.sql and Views.sql can be executed more than once.
